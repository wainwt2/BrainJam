CONTROLS:

Arrow Keys - Switch direction of gravity
W - Up
A - Left
S - Down
D - Right


In Reflection, you play as a ghost collecting objects containing memories of your previous
life.

You have two goals in each level: collect the memory object, then make it to the door.


The Arrow Keys can be used to switch the direction of gravity.  In each direction, you can
only land on one color tile.  The color associated with each direction is shown in the bottom
right corner.

Remember, momentum is conserved when you change the direction of gravity.

WASD is used to move and jump.  When gravity is facing down, W is used to jump.  When
gravity is facing left, D is used to jump, etc.


If you fall outside the boundaries of the screen, you will have to start the room over.
