Life has always been, and always will be, one of the great mysteries of time.
It is mysterious, inspiring...
...and yet, so powerfully finite.
Your mind is now open to all dimensions, you can see all realities.
However, before you move on to the next step in your journey, look back upon the events of your previous life.  Look back, so that you may take the lessons you learned and the memories you shared with you to the second life.
Eventually, given time, you may become one of us.
This, however, is your time.
This is your time of Reflection.
